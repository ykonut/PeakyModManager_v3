# PeakyModManager v3

A lightweight mod manager for **Zenless Zone Zero**.

> **This fork adds a native macOS build.** It is intended for running Zenless Zone Zero on macOS via **CrossOver** (or Wine/Whisky) and managing mods directly on the Mac. Only symlink handling and packaging were adapted for macOS; all functionality is unchanged.

## Features

- **Mod Management**
  Import, enable, and disable mods with ease.
- **Presets**
  Save multiple mod configurations and switch between them quickly.
- **Visual Interface**
  Clean, **Zenless Zone Zero–style** UI design.
- **Backup & Restore**
  Safely back up and restore preset configurations.
- **3DMigoto Toggle Editing**
  Inspect and edit persistent toggle states and key bindings directly in supported Mod INI files.

## Getting Started

### Initial Setup

Before using PeakyModManager, you need to configure the required paths:

1. Click the **Settings** button in the bottom bar.
2. **Library Path**
   Select the folder where your mods will be stored. This acts as the main _source_ directory.
3. **Target Path**
   Select the game's mod folder where mods will be installed.
   - For **ZZMI users**, this should be `ZZMI/ZZMI/Mods`.
4. **d3dx_user.ini Path** (optional)
   Select ZZMI's `d3dx_user.ini` if you want to use **Sync Toggles**. This is not required for editing a Mod's
   own Toggle states or key bindings.

### Importing Mods

- **Drag & Drop**

  Drag a mod folder directly into the application window to import it into your Library.
  Newly imported mods will appear in the **Unknown** category by default.

- **Use [PMM-Mod-Importer](https://github.com/Tian-W001/PMM_Mod_Importer)**

  Use the Chrome Extension to import the mod, the app will be opened and start downloading the mod.

- **Manual Import Notice**

  If you add mod folders directly through the file system instead of the app:
  - Click **Refresh** to detect them.
  - They will also be placed in the **Unknown** category by default.

---

### Enabling & Disabling Mods

1. Click a mod card to toggle its state:
   - **Yellow solid border** → Mod is **enabled**
   - **Black solid border** → Mod is **disabled**
   - **Yellow dashed border** → Mod is queued to be **enabled**
   - **Red dashed border** → Mod is queued to be **disabled**
2. The **Apply** button in the bottom bar shows the number of pending changes.
3. Click **Apply** to commit changes.
   This will create or remove **symbolic links** in the Target Path.

---

### Editing Mods

1. **Right-click** a mod card to open the edit modal.
2. You can edit:
   - Description
   - Mod Type
   - Character (for Character-type mods)
   - Source URL
3. **Delete**
   Deletes the **actual mod files** from disk.
4. **Autofill** will:
   - Automatically set the preview image:
     - Prefers images named `Preview`
     - Falls back to any available image, if present.
   - Automatically set the description:
     - Reads from a file named `readme`, if present
   - Attempt to match the mod title with a character name:
     - Sets the mod type to **Character**
     - Assigns the matched character
5. Click **Save** to apply changes.

### Editing 3DMigoto Toggles

When a Mod contains `global persist` constants, its edit modal includes a **Toggles** row:

- The left column shows the persistent constant, such as `$hair`.
- Click the current key binding, then press a key combination to replace it. Press `Esc` to cancel listening.
- Edit the numeric state in the right column. State and binding changes are saved immediately to the Mod's INI.
- Empty states return to their previously saved value, and non-numeric states are not written.

These edits only change files inside the Mod. They never modify `d3dx_user.ini`.

**Sync Toggles** is a separate, one-way operation. It reads runtime persistent values recorded in the configured
`d3dx_user.ini` and writes matching values back to the Mod's INI files. A constant that is not present in
`d3dx_user.ini` produces no sync change.

---

## Using Presets

1. Presets allow you to store and switch between different mod combinations.
2. Switch the active preset using the button in the **bottom-right corner**.
3. ⚠️ **Important**
   Loading a preset only queues changes as **Pending**.
   You must click **Apply** in the bottom bar to actually apply them.
4. Preset management:
   - Click the **+** button to manage presets.
   - Hover over a preset block to reveal the **Delete** button.

---

## Backup & Restore

Located in **Settings**:

- **Backup**
  - Saves preset configurations to: `Presets_Backup.json` inside your Library folder.
  - ⚠️ This will **overwrite** any existing backup file.

- **Restore**
  - Loads data from `Presets_Backup.json`.
  - ⚠️ This will **overwrite** your current preset configurations.
  - After restoring, you must **re-apply the current preset** from the pending queue to reflect changes.

## Auto Updates

- When you launch the app, wait a few seconds until a system notification pops up, indicating that a new version has been downloaded and will be installed after you quit the app.

## 3DMigoto / ZZMI INI Tools

The shared TypeScript parser preserves the original INI layout while exposing semantic queries for persistent
constants, key bindings, texture overrides, command lists, expressions, and current ZZMI SlotFix syntax.

Inspect one or more INI files from the command line:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/inspectThreeDMigoto.ts <file.ini> [more.ini...]
npx tsx scripts/inspectThreeDMigoto.ts --json <file.ini>
```

See [3DMigoto / ZZMI INI Parser Design](docs/three-dmigoto-ini-parser.md) for the supported syntax, TypeScript API,
and current limitations.
